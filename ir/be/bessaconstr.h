/**
 * @file
 * @brief       SSA construction for a set of nodes
 * @author      Sebastian Hack, Daniel Grund, Matthias Braun, Christian Wuerdig
 * @date        30.03.2007
 * @version     $Id$
 *
 * The problem: Given a value and a set of "copies" that are known to
 * represent the same abstract value, rewire all usages of the original value
 * to their closest copy while introducing phis as necessary.
 *
 * Algorithm: Mark all blocks in the iterated dominance frontiers of the value
 * and it's copies. Link the copies ordered by dominance to the blocks.  Then
 * we search for each use all definitions in the current block, if none is
 * found, then we search one in the immediate dominator. If we are in a block
 * of the dominance frontier, create a phi and do the same search for all
 * phi arguments.
 *
 * A copy in this context means, that you want to introduce several new
 * abstract values (in Firm: nodes) for which you know, that they
 * represent the same concrete value. This is the case if you
 * - copy
 * - spill and reload
 * - re-materialize
 * a value.
 *
 * This function reroutes all uses of the original value to the copies in the
 * corresponding dominance subtrees and creates Phi functions where necessary.
