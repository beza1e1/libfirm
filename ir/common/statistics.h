 * @author   Goetz Lindenmaier
 * @version  $Id$
 * @summary
 *  This file defines a set ouf routines to output statistics
 *  about the firm library.  These statistics include
 *   - number of datastructures allocated, as entities, types, nodes...
 *   - memory consumption of data structures
 *   - effectiveness of optimizations
 *   - ... more to come.
 *
 *  This file is thought for compiler optimization, not to run it in a
 *  production compiler. I.e., the routines may be inefficient.
