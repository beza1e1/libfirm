	   * After exchange_types the type has two entries in the list of
	     all types in irp.  So far this is fine for the walker.
	     Maybe it's better to remove the id entry and shrink the list.
	     Does this conflict with the walker?  Might a type be left out
	     during the walk?
	   * Deallocation:  if the Id is removed from the list it will eventually
	     disappear in a memory leak.  When is impossible to determine so we
	     need to hold it in a separate list for deallocation.
