 *    This file documents all datatypes and constructors needed to
 *    build a FIRM representation of a procedure.  The constructors are
 *    also implemented in this file.
 *
 *    The documentation also gives a short manual how to use the library.

 *
 *
 *    Three kinds of nodes
 *    --------------------
 *
 *      There are three kinds of nodes known to the IR:  entities,
 *      types, and ir_nodes
 *
 *      + ir_nodes are the actual nodes of the FIRM intermediate representation.
 *        They represent operations on the data of the program and control flow
 *        operations.
 *
 *      + entity ==> implemented in entity.h
 *        Refers to a single entity of the compiled program, e.g. a field of a
 *        class or a method.  If a method or variable can not be assigned to
 *        a method or class or the like, it is a global object.
 *
 *      + types ==> implemented in type.h
 *        With types type information is represented.  There are several type
 *       nodes.
 *
 *    Implementation of the FIRM operations: ir_node
 *    ----------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Ir_nodes represent operations on the data of the program and control flow
 *      operations.  Examples of ir_nodes:  Add, Jmp, Cmp
 *
 *      FIRM is a dataflow graph.  A dataflow graph is a directed graph,
 *      so that every node has incoming and outgoing edges.  A node is
 *      executable if every input at its incoming edges is available.
 *      Execution of the dataflow graph is started at the Start node which
 *      has no incoming edges and ends when the End node executes, even if
 *      there are still executable or not executed nodes.  (Is this true,
 *      or must all executable nodes be executed?)  (There are exceptions
 *      to the dataflow paradigma that all inputs have to be available
 *      before a node can execute: Phi, Block.  See UKA Techreport
 *      1999-14.)
 *
 *      The implementation of FIRM differs from the view as a dataflow
 *      graph.  To allow fast traversion of the graph edges are
 *      implemented as C-pointers.  Inputs to nodes are not ambiguous, the
 *      results can be used by several other nodes.  Each input can be
 *      implemented as a single pointer to a predecessor node, outputs
 *      need to be lists of pointers to successors.  Therefore a node
 *      contains pointers to its predecessors so that the implementation is a
 *      dataflow graph with reversed edges.  It has to be traversed bottom
 *      up.
 *
 *      All nodes of the IR have the same basic structure.  They are
 *      distinguished by a field containing the opcode.
 *
 *      The fields of an ir_node:
 *
 *      kind             A firm_kind tag containing k_ir_node.  This is useful for
 *                       dynamically checking the type of a node.
 *
 *      *op              This ir_op gives the opcode as a tag and a string
 *                       and the number of attributes of an ir_node.  There is
 *                       one statically allocated struct ir_op for each opcode.
 *
 *      *mode            The ir_mode of the operation represented by this firm
 *                       node.  The mode of the operation is the mode of its
 *                       result.  A Firm mode is a datatype as known to the
 *                       target, not a type of the source language.
 *
 *      visit            A flag for traversing the IR.
 *
 *      **in             An array with pointers to the node's predecessors.
 *
 *      *link            A pointer to an ir_node.  With this pointer all Phi nodes
 *                       are attached to a Block, i.e. a Block points to its
 *                       first Phi node, this node points to the second Phi node
 *                       in the Block and so forth.  Used in mature_immBlock
 *                       to find all Phi nodes to be matured.  It's also used to
 *                       annotate a node with a better, optimized version of it.
 *
 *      attr             An attr struct containing the attributes of the nodes. The
 *                       attributes depend on the opcode of the node.  The number
 *                       of these attributes is given in op.
 *
 *    The struct ir_op
 *    ----------------
 *                       Not yet documented. See irop.h.
 *
 *    The struct ir_mode
 *    ------------------
 *                       Not yet documented. See irmode.h.
 *
 *    GLOBAL VARIABLES -- now also fields of ir_graph.
 *    ================
 *
 *    current_ir_graph   Points to the current ir_graph.  All constructors for
 *                       nodes add nodes to this graph.
 *
 *    ir_visited         An int used as flag to traverse the ir_graph.
 *
 *    block_visited      An int used as a flag to traverse block nodes in the
 *                       graph.
 *
 *                       Others not yet documented.

 *    ========================
 *
 *
 *    PROCEDURE TO CONSTRUCT AN IR GRAPH --> see also Firm tutorial
 *    ==================================
 *
 *    This library supplies several interfaces to construct a FIRM graph for
 *    a program:
 *    - A "comfortable" interface generating SSA automatically.  Automatically
 *      computed predecessors of nodes need not be specified in the constructors.
 *      (new_<Node> constructurs and a set of additional routines.)
 *    - A less comfortable interface where all predecessors except the block
 *      an operation belongs to need to be specified.  SSA must be constructed
 *      by hand.  (new_<Node> constructors and set_cur_block()).  This interface
 *      is called "block oriented".  It automatically calles the local optimizations
 *      for each new node.
 *    - An even less comfortable interface where the block needs to be specified
 *      explicitly.  This is called the "raw" interface. (new_r_<Node>
 *      constructors).  These nodes are not optimized.
 *
 *    To use the functionality of the comfortable interface correctly the Front
 *    End needs to follow certain protocols.  This is explained in the following.
 *    To build a correct IR with the other interfaces study the semantics of
 *    the firm node (See tech-reprot UKA 1999-14).  For the construction of
 *    types and entities see the documentation in those modules.
 *
 *    First the Frontend needs to decide which variables and values used in
 *    a procedure can be represented by dataflow edges.  These are variables
 *    that need not be saved to memory as they cause no side effects visible
 *    out of the procedure.  Often these are all compiler generated
 *    variables and simple local variables of the procedure as integers,
 *    reals and pointers.  The frontend has to count and number these variables.
 *
 *    First an ir_graph needs to be constructed with new_ir_graph.  The
 *    constructor gets the number of local variables.  The graph is held in the
 *    global variable irg.
 *
 *    Now the construction of the procedure can start.  Several basic blocks can
 *    be constructed in parallel, but the code within each block needs to
 *    be constructed (almost) in program order.
 *
 *    A global variable holds the current basic block.  All (non block) nodes
 *    generated are added to this block.  The current block can be set with
 *    set_cur_block(block).  If several blocks are constructed in parallel block
 *    switches need to be performed constantly.
 *
 *    To generate a Block node (with the comfortable interface), its predecessor
 *    control flow nodes need not be known.  In case of cyclic control flow these
 *    can not be known when the block is constructed.  With add_immBlock_pred(block,
 *    cfnode) predecessors can be added to the block.  If all predecessors are
 *    added to the block mature_immBlock(b) needs to be called.  Calling mature_immBlock
 *    early improves the efficiency of the Phi node construction algorithm.
 *    But if several  blocks are constructed at once, mature_immBlock must only
 *    be called after performing all set_values and set_stores in the block!
 *    (See documentation of new_immBlock constructor.)
 *
 *    The constructors of arithmetic nodes require that their predecessors
 *    are mentioned.  Sometimes these are available in the Frontend as the
 *    predecessors have just been generated by the frontend.  If they are local
 *    values, the predecessors can be obtained from the library with a call to
 *    get_value(local_val_nr).  (local_val_nr needs to be administered by
 *    the Frontend.)  A call to get_value triggers the generation of Phi nodes.
 *    If an arithmetic operation produces a local value, this value needs to be
 *    passed to the library by set_value(node, local_val_nr).
 *    In straight line code these two operations just remember and return the
 *    pointer to nodes producing the value.  If the value passes block boundaries
 *    Phi nodes can be inserted.
 *    Similar routines exist to manage the Memory operands: set_store and
 *    get_store.
 *
 *    Several nodes produce more than one result.  An example is the Div node.
 *    Such nodes return tuples of values.  From these individual values can be
 *    extracted by proj nodes.
 *
 *    The following example illustrates the construction of a simple basic block
 *    with two predecessors stored in variables cf_pred1 and cf_pred2, containing
 *    the code
 *      a = a div a;
 *    and finally jumping to an other block.  The variable a got the local_val_nr
 *    42 by the frontend.
 *
 *    ir_node *this_block, *cf_pred1, *cf_pred2, *a_val, *mem, *div, *res, *cf_op;
 *
 *    this_block = new_immBlock();
 *    add_immBlock_pred(this_block, cf_pred1);
 *    add_immBlock_pred(this_block, cf_pred2);
 *    mature_immBlock(this_block);
 *    a_val = get_value(42, mode_Iu);
 *    mem = get_store();
 *    div = new_Div(mem, a_val, a_val, mode_Iu);
 *    mem = new_Proj(div, mode_M, pn_Div_M);   * for the numbers for Proj see docu *
 *    res = new_Proj(div, mode_Iu, pn_Div_res);
 *    set_store(mem);
 *    set_value(res, 42);
 *    cf_op = new_Jmp();
 *
 *    For further information look at the documentation of the nodes and
 *    constructors and at the paragraph COPING WITH DATA OBJECTS at the
 *    end of this documentation.

 *
 *    IR_NODES AND CONSTRUCTORS FOR IR_NODES
 *    =======================================
 *
 *    All ir_nodes are defined by a common data structure.  They are distinguished
 *    by their opcode and differ in the number of their attributes.
 *
 *    Const nodes are always added to the start block.
 *    All other constructors add the created node to the current_block.
 *    swich_block(block) allows to set the current block to block.
 *
 *    Watch for my inconsistent use of input and predecessor (dataflow view)
 *    and `the node points to' (implementation view).
 *
 *    The following description of the nodes lists four properties them if these
 *    are of interest:
 *     - the parameters to the constructor
 *     - the inputs of the Firm node
 *     - the outputs of the Firm node
 *     - attributes to the node
 *
 *    ------------
 *
 *    ir_node *new_immBlock (void)
 *    ----------------------------
 *
 *    Creates a new block. When a new block is created it cannot be known how
 *    many predecessors this block will have in the control flow graph.
 *    Therefore the list of inputs can not be fixed at creation.  Predecessors
 *    can be added with add_immBlock_pred (block, control flow operation).
 *    With every added predecessor the number of inputs to Phi nodes also
 *    changes.
 *
 *    The block can be completed by mature_immBlock(block) if all predecessors are
 *    known.  If several blocks are built at once, mature_immBlock can only be called
 *    after set_value has been called for all values that are life at the end
 *    of the block.  This is necessary so that Phi nodes created mature_immBlock
 *    get the right predecessors in case of cyclic dependencies.  If all set_values
 *    of this block are called after maturing it and before calling get_value
 *    in some block that is control flow dependent on this block, the construction
 *    is correct.
 *
 *    Example for faulty IR construction:  (draw the graph on a paper and you'll
 *                                          get it ;-)
 *
 *      block_before_loop = new_immBlock();
 *      set_cur_block(block_before_loop);
 *      set_value(x);
 *      mature_immBlock(block_before_loop);
 *      before2header = new_Jmp;
 *
 *      loop_header = new_immBlock ();
 *      set_cur_block(loop_header);
 *      header2body - new_Jmp();
 *
 *      loop_body = new_immBlock ();
 *      set_cur_block(loop_body);
 *      body2header = new_Jmp();
 *
 *      add_immBlock_pred(loop_header, before2header);
 *      add_immBlock_pred(loop_header, body2header);
 *      add_immBlock_pred(loop_body, header2body);
 *
 *      mature_immBlock(loop_header);
 *      mature_immBlock(loop_body);
 *
 *      get_value(loop_body, x);   //  gets the Phi in loop_header
 *      set_value(loop_header, x); //  sets the value the above get_value should
 *                                 //  have returned!!!
 *
 *    Mature_immBlock also fixes the number of inputs to the Phi nodes.  Mature_immBlock
 *    should be called as early as possible, as afterwards the generation of Phi
 *    nodes is more efficient.
 *
 *    Inputs:
 *      There is an input for each control flow predecessor of the block.
 *      The input points to an instruction producing an output of type X.
 *      Possible predecessors:  Start, Jmp, Cond, Raise or Return or any node
 *      possibly causing an exception.  (Often the real predecessors are Projs.)
 *    Output:
 *      Mode BB (R), all nodes belonging to this block should consume this output.
 *      As they are strict (except Block and Phi node) it is a necessary condition
 *      that the block node executed before any other node in this block executes.
 *    Attributes:
 *      block.matured  Indicates whether the block is mature.
 *      block.**graph_arr
 *                      This attribute contains all local values valid in this
 *                      block. This is needed to build the Phi nodes and removed
 *                      if the graph is complete.  This field is used by the
 *              internal construction algorithm and should not be accessed
 *              from outside.
 *
 *
 *    ir_node *new_Block (int arity, ir_node **in)
 *    --------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Creates a new Block with the given list of predecessors.  This block
 *    is mature.  As other constructors calls optimization and verify for the
 *    block.  If one of the predecessors is Unknown (as it has to be filled in
 *    later) optimizations are skipped.  This is necessary to
 *    construct Blocks in loops.
 *
 *
 *    CONTROL FLOW OPERATIONS
 *    -----------------------
 *
 *    In each block there must be exactly one of the control flow
 *    operations Start, End, Jmp, Cond, Return or Raise.  The output of a
 *    control flow operation points to the block to be executed next.
 *
 *    ir_node *new_Start (void)
 *    -------------------------
 *
 *    Creates a start node.  Not actually needed public.  There is only one such
 *   node in each procedure which is automatically created by new_ir_graph.
 *
 *    Inputs:
 *      No inputs except the block it belongs to.
 *    Output:
 *      A tuple of 4 (5, 6) distinct values. These are labeled by the following
 *      projection numbers (pn_Start):
 *      * pn_Start_X_initial_exec    mode X, points to the first block to be exe *                                   cuted.
 *      * pn_Start_M                 mode M, the global store
 *      * pn_Start_P_frame_base      mode P, a pointer to the base of the proce  *                                   dures stack frame.
 *      * pn_Start_P_globals         mode P, a pointer to the part of the memory *                                   containing_all_ global things.
 *      * pn_Start_T_args            mode T, a tuple containing all arguments of *                                   the procedure.
 *
 *
 *    ir_node *new_End (void)
 *    -----------------------
 *
 *    Creates an end node.  Not actually needed public.  There is only one such
 *   node in each procedure which is automatically created by new_ir_graph.
 *
 *    Inputs:
 *      No inputs except the block it belongs to.
 *    Output:
 *      No output.
 *
 *    ir_node *new_Jmp (void)

 *
 *    In general, Phi nodes are automaitcally inserted.  In some cases, if
 *    all predecessors of a block are known, an explicit Phi node constructor
 *    is needed.  E.g., to construct a FIRM graph for a statement as
 *      a = (b==c) ? 2 : 5;
 *
 *    ir_node *new_Phi (int arity, ir_node **in, ir_mode *mode)
 *    ---------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Creates a Phi node. The in's order has to correspond to the order
 *    of in's of current_block.  This is not checked by the library!
 *    If one of the predecessors is Unknown (as it has to be filled in
 *    later) optimizations are skipped.  This is necessary to
 *    construct Phi nodes in loops.

 *
 *    ir_node *new_Tuple (int arity, ir_node **in)
 *    --------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Builds a Tuple from single values.  This is needed to implement
 *    optimizations that remove a node that produced a tuple.  The node can be
 *    replaced by the Tuple operation so that the following Proj nodes have not to
 *    be changed.  (They are hard to find due to the implementation with pointers
 *    in only one direction.)  The Tuple node is smaller than any other
 *    node, so that a node can be changed into a Tuple by just changing its
 *    opcode and giving it a new in array.
 *
 *    Parameters
 *      arity    The number of tuple elements.
 *      **in     An array containing pointers to the nodes producing the
 *               tuple elements.

 *    ir_node *new_Bound  (ir_node *store, ir_node *idx, ir_node *lower, ir_node *upper);
 *    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Describes a high level bounds check. Must be lowered to a Call to a runtime check
 *    function.
 *
 *    ir_node *new_Pin  (ir_node *node);
 *    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Pin the value of the node node in the current block  No users of the Pin node can
 *    float above the Block of the Pin. The node cannot float behind this block. Often
 *    used to Pin the NoMem node.
 *
 *
 *    COPING WITH DATA OBJECTS
 *    ========================
 *
 *    Two kinds of data objects have to be distinguished for generating
 *    FIRM.  First there are local variables other than arrays that are
 *    known to be alias free.  Second there are all other data objects.
 *    For the first a common SSA representation is built, the second
 *    are modeled by saving them to memory.  The memory is treated as
 *    a single local variable, the alias problem is hidden in the
 *    content of this variable.
 *
 *    All values known in a Block are listed in the block's attribute,
 *    block.**graph_arr which is used to automatically insert Phi nodes.
 *    The following two functions can be used to add a newly computed value
 *    to the array, or to get the producer of a value, i.e., the current
 *    live value.
 *
 *    inline void set_value (int pos, ir_node *value)
 *    -----------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Has to be called for every assignment to a local variable.  It
 *    adds the value to the array of used values at position pos.  Pos
 *    has to be a unique identifier for an entry in the procedure's
 *    definition table.  It can be used to access the value again.
 *    Requires current_block to be set correctly.
 *
 *    ir_node *get_value (int pos, ir_mode *mode)
 *    -------------------------------------------
 *
 *    Returns the node defining the value referred to by pos. If the
 *    value is not defined in this block a Phi node is generated and
 *    all definitions reaching this Phi node are collected.  It can
 *    happen that the algorithm allocates an unnecessary Phi node,
 *    e.g. if there is only one definition of this value, but this
 *    definition reaches the currend block on several different
 *    paths.  This Phi node will be eliminated if optimizations are
 *    turned on right after its creation.
 *    Requires current_block to be set correctly.
 *
 *    There are two special routines for the global store:
 *
 *    void set_store (ir_node *store)
 *    -------------------------------
 *
 *    Adds the store to the array of known values at a reserved
 *    position.
 *    Requires current_block to be set correctly.
 *
 *    ir_node *get_store (void)
 *    -------------------------
 *
 *    Returns the node defining the actual store.
 *    Requires current_block to be set correctly.
 *
 *
 *    inline void keep_alive (ir_node *ka)
 *    ------------------------------------
 *
 *    Keep this node alive because it is (might be) not in the control
 *    flow from Start to End.  Adds the node to the list in the end
 *   node.
