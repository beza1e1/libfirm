 * @brief
 *  Decompost control flow graph into acylic, hierarchic intervals.
 *
 *  The analysis is based on the control flow looptree.  An intervall
 *  are basically all nodes in a single ir_loop entry, i.e., basic
 *  blocks and inner loop nodes.  The analysis computes a new set of
 *  edges that link all nodes of a loop to an acyclic graph.
 *
 *  The interval analysis counts the number of exception control flow
 *  operations leaving a block.  This depends on stuff computed in
 *  execution_freqencies.
