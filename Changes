  7.6.2001 Goetz
  ifdef'ed all uses of gmp in tv.c away.  Optimizations for
  mode_Z no more supported, as well as constants of that mode.

  7.6.2001 Goetz
  Dokumentation in ir_dump
  Habe Routinen fuer einzelne Knoten/Kanten aus header entfernt:
  Benutzen globale Variable die nicht oeffentlich zugaenglich ist.

  28.5.2001 Goetz
  We need an entity for the array elements for the Sel nodes.  This
  entity should be stored in the array type.  Changed constructor
  parameters: include array element type.  Entity for elements is built
  automatically now.

  28.5.2001 Goetz
  Removed bug in tv.c.
  Faulty use of va_arg, became visible with new, stricter gcc 2.96.

  23.5.2001 Goetz
  Added list of member entites to union.  unioned_types and delimiters
  are superfluous now -- removed.
  Rationale: we want to express selection of a union member as a Sel
  node. for this we need to have entities.  The entities contain the
  unioned type and have as name the delimiters...

  17.4.2001 Boris
  Changed Makefile/MakeTargets to install headers and libraries
  seperately.

  28.3.2001 Boris
  Changed Makefile and Configure scripts to produce a proper tar file
  for distribution (libfirm-VERSION.tar)
  Use 'make distrib' instead of 'make dist'

  14.3.2001 Goetz
  Changed implementation of tr module.  With this I also changed the
  interface!!  Type casts are unnecessary now, but some access funcions
  differ.


======================================================================
==================== New version: 0.3.0 ==============================
======================================================================

  14.3.2001 Boris
  added file TODO

  14.3.2001 Boris
  added creation of a tar archive for distribution
  replaced ir/.dummy.in by ir/Makefile.in

  13.3.2001 Goetz
  Changed equivalent_node() and copy_preds() so that the end block
  is not optimized away if it has no real predecessors.  This fixes
  the problem with the while examples.
  Added while_example in Makefile

  12.3.2001 Goetz
  Fooled around with if_while_example: Why does cse make it abort?
  Cse removes path to End node, Bad remains as pred of Endblock.
  The block walker can't deal with this.
  Made new example with only loop:  while_example.

  12.3.2001 Boris
  added auto documentation in Makefiles, configure, etc
  example in ir/ir/ircons.c - much must be added
  creation of documentation by 'make autodoc' in architecture directory

  5.3.2001 Boris
  added lots of #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_G #include "config.h" #endif
  replaced some C++ style comments (//) by standard C comments /**/
  added autoconf stuff
  worked this night:
	- configure (with some features, see --help for more)
	- make [depend | tags | install]
	- make [run] in testprograms
  did not work:
	- compilation on SunOS
	- make dist
	- automatic call of autoconf if required

  5.3.2001 Goetz
  More colours in vcg output.
  Fixed bug:  cse found that start block equals it's
  first successor as both have the Start block as predecessor.
  This only happens for local_optimize_graph() as during construction
  the Start block is not entered in the value table.
  Changed implementation:  irgmod:  local_optimize_graph() did not
  empty the hash table with the irnodes for cse.  This might cause that
  cse turns up with a node that seems better but was removed from the
  graph in an earlier optimization phase.
  Removed old #if 1 from ircons.c
  Commented in call of optimization for Block nodes in irgopt.c, copy_preds():
  Optimizes blocks that had bad predecessors.
  Same for Phi nodes.


  27.2.2001 Goetz
  Moved struct from irprog.h to irprog_t.h, same for irmode.h.
  Added a module deb_info in debug.h.  Adapted makefile.  Added example
  use in iropt.h.
  Removed use of debug.h in ident.c. Now debug.c|h can be moved to
  /adt/.
  Removed inabled code for dead node elimination in irgopt.h.
  Renamed some missnamed access routines (_of_).  Macros with old names
  are in old_fctnames.h.
  Edited makefiles to remove #* and *.flc.

  ??.2.2001 Goetz
  Some minor bugfixes...

  25.1.2001 Goetz
  After compacting of in arrays in dead_node_elimination
  merge blocks and remove Phis with one pred.

  24.1.2001 Goetz
  Freeing of obstack in dead_node_elimination commented in.
  Compacting in arrays of Block and Phi nodes in dead_node_
  elimination.
  Some more changes...

  15.01.2001 Goetz
  added set/get_SymConst_type_or_id in irnode.h
  added field offset to entity in entity.h
  added field size to type_class in type.h
  include "gmp.h" in tv.h with "" instead <>

  12.01.2001 Goetz
  Some changes to make the lib better portable

  29.12.2000 Goetz
  Initialize max_node_nr in irprog.

  27.12.2000 Goetz
  Now outputs warning if faulty type in irdump, dump_type_info.
  Explicit string termination in irdump, vcg_open.

  20.12.2000 Goetz
  Added external to declaration of irp.
  Added typedef before pns and pnc_number.
  irmode.c, init_mode(): We need to memset all new modes as
  tarval_vrfy reads fields before they are initialized: It
  compares to min/max when tarvals for min/max are allocated!

  18.12.2000 Goetz
  Changed parameter of Methods in type.h and type.c from
  class to clss.  Class is a C++ keyword.

  10.12.2000 Goetz
  Changed some testprograms to accomodate Uebprakt.

  7.9.2000 Goetz
  Finished implementation of dump_all_types.
  Added new testprogram inheritance_example.

  6.9.2000 Chris
  Added seven access routines in type.[hc]:
  get_class_n_member, get_class_n_subtype, get_class_n_supertype,
  get_strct_n_member, add_strct_member, get_strct_member and set_strct_member.
  Fixed the type_walk_2 for those seven routines.

  6.9.2000 Goetz
  Added irdump routine dump_all_types.
  Did changes to irprog, type, typewalk to achieve this.
  typewalk needs to walk along members, sub and supertypes, this
  is still missing!  irdump then needs to output these edges.

======================================================================
==================== New version: 0.2.5 ==============================
======================================================================

  3.9.2000 Goetz
  Made new Version: 0.2.5

  15.8.2000 Goetz until 3.9.00
  Separated irnode.h and many others into two files: one public
  one private.
  Added funcionality to extract headers for lib.

  23.8.2000 Goetz
  type_dump also dumps irg->ent
  if_example: corrected nr of locals

  16.8.2000 Goetz
  irgopt: Correct copy of self pointer in start block.
  irgopt: Correct treatment of loops: pre function in walker
    breaks all possible loops in Phi and Block nodes.
  irr_loop_example: wrong Return statement
  Now I fixed all but one error: in memory_example.
  This error showed a conceptual problem, so I wrote
  a slightly different algorithm.  This now runs for
  all testprograms.
  dead_node_example: cse is buggy!! merges start and the
  following block!

  15.8.2000 Goetz
  looking at bug in dead_node_elimination.
  Following fixes:
  irnode:  all get_..._arr functions changed
  ircons:  new_r_Block: set matured flag.
  ircons:  new_r_SymConst: needs mode_p for linkage_ptr_info.
  adapted call_str_example to new concepts.

  2.8.2000 Goetz
  Implemented simpler Phi construction algorithm that constructs
  correct code for three_cfpred_example in ircons.  This algorithm
  generates more Id nodes than the original algorithm and therefore
  is less effective.
  Also made some changes to optimizations of Not.

  31.7.2000 Chris
  Fixed a bug, caused by the recursive use in type.h and entity.h.
  Deleted the _TYPE_TYPEDEF_ and inserted the _ENTITY_TYPEDEF_ instead.
  Fixed a problem in if_while testprogram, so it now works.

  20.7.2000 Goetz
  Fixed bug in optimize(). Returned Null instead n if
  get_optimize() == false.

  19.7.2000 Christian
  Added some access routines in type.[hc]. Solved a recursive definition
  of type_class struct, entity struct and type union.

  18.7.2000 Goetz
  Separated entity header into pure functional header and header
  with data types.

  Goetz
  ... a bunch small changes not documented

  12.7.2000 Goetz
  Changed output of oo_prog_example: now uses the internal list
  of all irgs.  Had to implement some of the access routines for
  that.  Also fixed a bug in irdump.  Main routines did not use
  current_ir_graph properly.

  12.7.2000 Goetz
  Implemented some missing parts in irgopt.
  Added field irg to entity. Only valid if entity is a method.
  Had to resove a cyclic de[endency between irgraph.h and entity.h
  for this.
  Added fields sub and super to type_class for inheritance.
  Added field main_irg to irprog.

  7.7.2000 Chris
  Fixed some bugs in irgopt.c
  Added some missing 'get_new_node' methods, so the new obstack contains
  the correct nodes.

  6.7.2000 Chris
  Renamed ir_vrfy to irn_vrfy and vrfy_graphg to irg_vrfy.
  Solved some copy'n'paste problems. Deleted most debug-code!
  Added comments to several files.

  6.7.2000 Goetz
  Fixed bug in _r_ constructors for all four Div operations.
  Fixed bug in turn_into_tuple: didn't remember the block.
  Tested transform_node.

  5.7.2000 Goetz
  Fixed some testprograms to new semantics of firm.
  Added testprogram global_var_example.
  Fixed a bug in irop:  Size of Sel node was (entity *) instead of
  sel_attr.  Therefor array_heap_example aborted.
  Also found a missing break in typewalk, case iro_Alloc.
  Added a construct that unifies all things constructed by the lib
  and needed to represent a program:  irprog.ch
  This contains a list of all types as well as a list of all ir graphs.
  I added calls to initialization and constructors so that this is constructed
  automatically.  I changed firm.c, type.c, irgraph.c and ev. more.
  Removed strange block struct and constructor from ircons.c.
  Moved routines for automatic Phi construction from irgmod to ircons.
  Sorted functions in ircons to reflect the different interfaces.
  Renamed dataseg to globals to be conformant with documentation.
  Added conservation of current_ir_graph to irgopt.c.
  Corrected bug in Makefiles: wrong path to directory ./inlude.

  4.7.2000 Goetz
  Commented a whole bunch of stuff, e.g. in ircons.h  (Procedure to construct)
  We should change the naming of the Block constructor.
  Removed acces routines to attr. "closed" of Block.
  Removed second implementation of new_ir_node from ircons and some comments
  concerned with the now resolved cyclic dependency.
  Fixed some bugs in irgopt so that the compilation goes through.

  29.6.2000 Chris
  Changed the irnode attribut 'visit' into 'visited'.
  Added some access functions, like get/set_irn_visit etc.

  28.6.2000 Chris
  Renamed some access funtion in irgraph.*.
  Deleted two global flags (ir_visited and block_visited) from irgraph.*.
  Added two attributes to the irgraph struct. The visited flags belongs
  to a ir graph, not to a whole program.

  26.6.2000 Chris
  A new optimization has been finished. The dead-node-elimination copies
  the existing ir graph from one opstack to another. While walking the
  graph, only the reachable nodes will be copied, so the "dead-nodes"
  (unreachable in the controlflow) are removed.

  19.6.2000 Chris
  Solved some problems in the 'copy_node' function. The in array was not
  as easy as it seamed.

  16.6.2000 Chris
  Wrote a new 'post' funtion, for future use in 'dead-node-elimination'
  optimization, which is needed in the paramter list of 'irg_walk'.

  14.6.2000 Chris
  Moved 'optimze_in_place_wrapper' from iropt.* tothe new files irgopt.*.
  New functions 'local_optimze_graph' and 'dead_node_elimination' are added,
  but not finished.

  31.5.2000 Chris
  Removed some files from the archive, after dependencies and usage are
  checked:
  - 'ir/common/strerror.c'
  was nowhere used;
  - 'ir/ident/xx_ident.h'
  an empty file, only included by 'ident.c', but never used;
  - 'ir/tv/label.c' and
  - 'ir/tv/label.h'
  contained a numeric counter;
  The files were included in 'tv.h' and implemented in 'tarval.c'. The two
  functions 'tarval_label' and 'tarval_forall_labeled' were also never used.
  In the old fiasco compiler, the label thing is used in the backend.
  Search for 'babil' to see the usage.
  Also removed the two attributes 'lab' and 'used' in the tarval struct.

  26.5.2000 Chris
  Moved the 'new_ir_node' constructor from ircons.* to irnode.* and fixed
  afterwards some recursive includes, so libfirm works again.

  2+3.2000 Goetz
  Did a lot of changes, which I never commented until now (4.7.00).

  * Added new result to Start node: Pointer to global data segment.
  * Extended Semantics of SymConst node to represent information for the
    linker.
  * Added arithmeitc nodes (Shrs, Minus ...)

  Rearranged the directory structure and adjusted the makefiles.
  The directories contain:
  ir:       everything for the intermediate representation (better: src?)
    /ir:    the ir itself, and standard optimizations.
    /tv:    the target value module
    /tr:    the type and entity representation
    /adt:   abstract data types
    /common:  stuff needed by all other dirs
    /debug: debugging Unterstuetzung
    /ident:
  include:  external files needen as includes
  testprograms: examples to test the lib.

  The makefiles generate files with extension .d that contain the dependencies
  between the files.

  15.2.2000 Goetz
  Added access routine to attribute link of irnode in irnode.ch.
  Added get_negated_pnc to irnode.ch.

  14.2.2000 Goetz
  Added an iterator in iropt that calls the optimization for all nodes.
  Copied optimize's code to optimize_in_place and removed deallocations.
  Made set_irn_n in irnode.c public.
  Added Bad as possible cfg predecessor in is_cfg_node in irnode.  Bads
  are allowded as cfgpredecessors to represent dead "incoming" control
  flow.
  Added call to optimize_in_place in mature_block. Is this useful?

  10.2.2000 Goetz
  Changed tests from comparing enums to comparing pointers. This is more
  efficient (is it?) and reads better.  e.g., instead get_irn_opcode == irm_And
  now get_irn_op == op_And

  10.2.2000 Goetz
  Compared equivalent_value to the one in the original fiasco.
  Added a test in case iro_And.
  Changed implementation of iro_Div. Added routines turn_into_tuple
    and set_irn_op() in irgmod/irnode.
  Changed implementation of irn_Minus (although commented out).
  Now all features are ported or documented for this function.

  10.2.2000 Goetz
  Compared computed_value to the one in the original fiasco.
  Added one further optimization in case iro_Proj.
  Now all features are ported for this function.

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Updated comments in ircons.h.

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Changed possible attribute of SymConst from type_class to type.
  SymConst size could be the size of a union, array, ...

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Implemented two dumpers that dump type information and a graph with
  type information.

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Implemented a walker that walks over the type informatin that can
  be reached from an ir node.
  Added routine get_kind(firm_thing) in common.h, Added file common.c.
  Added files typewalk.ch and routines to irdump.
  Added visited flags and initialization to entity and all types.
  Implemented some of the missing access routines in type.c, entity.c

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Implemented constructor for ShrA.
  Added type struct.
  Added routine that iterates the graph and verifies all nodes.
  Added Phi_in stack to irgraph.  This allows to build several
    graphs at once with respect to the Phi building algorithm.

  9.2.2000 Goetz
  Implemented dumper for control flow graphs.  Changed irr_* and dead_*
  examples to dump cfg.

  8.2.2000 Goetz
  Implemeted explicit stack for the Phi node generation.  See ircons.c.

  8.2.2000 Goetz
  added include string.h in xoprintf.c to get rid of warning:
  implicit declaration of function `bcopy'

  7.2.2000 Goetz
  Worked on iropt.c:
  Added more cases to equivalent_node.
  Portet gigo, identify, identify_remember.
  The set/pset library can not handle several hash tables.  At least,
  compiling several procedures causes a segmentation fault during access
  to the tables (oo_program_example).  Need to work on this.
  transform_node still needs to be ported.
  some cases in equivalent_node are still missing.

  To get it running I had to remove the call to optimize in the
  new_Block constructor. It can only be called when the Block is
  mature.

  7.2.2000 Goetz
  Introduced a walker that walks only over blocks.  The asserts
  might be too strict for general graphs, but so far it works.
  For the walker I introduced an additional flag in the attribute
  of Blocks, an a global block_visited variable (in irgraph.h).
  Furhter I modularized dump_ir_node, implemented dump_ir_graph
  with the existing walker, and added new routines to output a
  basic block graph.
  Changed the examples to call the new dump routine.

  7.2.2000 Goetz
  Added auxiliary routines to ir_node:
  skip_Proj, skip_Nop, is_Bad ...
  Changed access routines to use get_irn_n instead of explicit array
  accesses. Changed get_irn_n to call skip_Id, so that the access routines
  never will return Id nodes.

  3.2.2000 Goetz
  Repaired Phi computation, changed new_r_Phi_in.  Added test program to
  test irregular controlflow.

  2.2.2000 Goetz
  Updated optimizations computed_value and equivalent_node to new
  Syntax of FIRM nodes and to use access routines.
  Added routine skip_Proj in irnode.

  2.2.2000 Boris Boesler
  Added files irgwalk.c and irgwalk.h. They include a simple function to
  traverse an ir graph and execute pre and post functions to current node.

  1.2.2000 Goetz
  Added arrays with parameters and result types to the type informtion
  of a procedure.  This is needed for the code generation.  Also added
  the corresponding access routines.
  Adapted the testprograms.

  1.2.2000 Goetz
  Found a bug / complication:  the call order
    get_value   (makes Phi0, put's it into graph_arr)
    set_value   (overwrites Phi0 in graph_arr)
    mature_block (upgrades Phi0, puts it again into graph_arr, overwriting
                  the proper value.)
  fails.  Added test wether graph_arr is already set in phi_merge.

  Added tons of comments to explain Phi generation -- the stack hack.


  27.1.2000 Goetz
  irdump now outputs the pnc_number for projs of Cmp nodes.
  Added routine to access the pnc_string.

  27.1.2000 Goetz
  Added result "dataseg" to Start node, with all it's consequences.
  We need this for the compiler lab to translate global variables.
  Now they can be selected from the data segment, and the start
  node supplies the pointer to this segment.
  These changes are guarded by preprocessor variable UEBPRAKT in
  common.h
  Changed files: common.h, irgraph.ch, irnode.h

  26.1.2000 Goetz
  Testprograms:
  removed array_example, added array-heap_example and
  array-stack_example and adapted makefile.
  ir_lib:
  Entity now also allows type_method as owner. This is to model
  the stack, Sel nodes that select a variable (array) from the
  stack need an entity that describes what they select.  This
  entity gets the type of the enclosing procedure as owner.

  24.1.2000 Chris
  Added future access routines in `irmode.[ch]' as comments,
    that all attributes in the ir_mode struct can be user-defined.
  Added access routines in `irgraph.[ch]', for all attributes.

  22.1.2000 Chris
  Moved verify routines from `irgraph.[ch]' to own files `irvrfy.[ch]'.
  Added `irvrfy.[ch]' to MAKEFILE
  Added "inline" before access routines in `irnode.h', that no warnings
    will appear furthermore.
  Added three more access routines in `irmode.[ch]':
	struct tarval *get_min_of_mode (ir_mode *mode);
	struct tarval *get_max_of_mode (ir_mode *mode);
	struct tarval *get_null_of_mode (ir_mode *mode);

  21.1.2000 Goetz
  Adaption of Alloc, Sel and Entity to new types:
    Changed array_example to use type instead of type_class.
    Changed entity to allow all types as owner instead of
      only type_class.  Added routine "assert_legal_owner_of_ent(type* type)".
    Changed alloc to allow allocating variables of any type instead of
      only type_class.
    Adapted all testprograms to avoid warnings.

  removed dtest ... from Makefile, replaced by test.

  20.1.2000 Goetz
  Added "run" to makefile, added array_example to makefile of testprograms.
  Corrected testprogram array
  Changed assert in irvrfy -- Conv.
  Started Change log.
  Started TODO log.
