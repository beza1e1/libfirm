Call
  sh build_firm_jni
to generate a Java native interface for firm.

Generating the JNI requires various syntactic properties of the
header files that restrict legal C.

Do not use methods that generate a non null terminated String
from Idents (as idToStr).  This will probably cause a segmentation
fault.

Some methods generated might not work yet.  Please report this to
goetz@ipd.info.uni-karlsruhe.de. Do not use methods with function
pointers as arguments.

For now _all_ enumerators are generated into _all_ classes.
This results from deficiencies in the crecoder and will be removed
at some place.
Use only the enumerators defined in the corresponding c headers.
E.g., irm_X is defined in irmode.h, so use Irmode.irm_X, but not
Type.irm_X or any other definition in the java files.
