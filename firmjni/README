Call
  sh build_firm_jni
to generate a Java native interface for firm.

This script still contains various IPD specific settings,
e.g. oaths to the header files needed for JNI.  This will be changed
at some point.

Generating the JNI requires various syntactic properties of the
header files that restrict legal C.

Do not use methods that generate a non null terminated String
from Idents (as idToStr).  This will probably cause a segmentation
fault.

Some methods generated might not work yet.  Please report this to
goetz@ipd.info.uni-karlsruhe.de

For now _all_ enumerators are generated into _all_ classes.
This results from deficiencies in the crecoder and will be removed
at some place.
Use only the enumerators defined in the corresponding c headers.
E.g., irm_X is defined in irmode.h, so use Irmode.irm_X, but not
Type.irm_X or any other definition in the java files.
