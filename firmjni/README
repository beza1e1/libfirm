This directory contains tools to generate a Java Native Interface
for libfirm.

The tools generate for each libfirm header file a Java class
containing native method calls and static fields.  The native methods
are derived from the methods in the corresponding libfirm header.  The
method names are generated by replacing all occurences of '_x' by 'X'.
(The libfirm headers may not contain method names that only differ by
capitalizing the letter after an underscore.)
The static fields are derived from the enumerators in libfirm.

The generator copies the comments from the header files to the Java
files.  Sometimes it places the comments slightly wrong, i.e. one
definition too high or too low.  As the comments are directly copied
they refer to the C names.

Generating the JNI requires various syntactic properties of the
header files that restrict legal C.  These restrictions will be
relaxed at some point.

Do not use methods that generate a non null terminated String
from Idents (as idToStr).  This will probably cause a segmentation
fault.
Do not use methods that accept or return function pointers.

Some other methods generated might not work yet.  Please report this to
goetz@ipd.info.uni-karlsruhe.de.

WARNING:
For now _all_ enumerators are generated into _all_ classes.
This results from deficiencies in the crecoder and will be removed
at some place.
Use only the enumerators defined in the corresponding c headers.
E.g., irm_X is defined in irmode.h, so use Irmode.irm_X, but not
Type.irm_X or any other definition in the java files.
