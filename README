This is a library implementing the intermediate representation
FIRM developed at IPD Goos, Uni Karlsruhe.

Call make lib to construct the library.  This creates a file
libfirm.a and extracts all necessary header files to ./include.

To test the library goto ./testprograms and make and run the
test examples placed there:

make lib
cd testprograms
make
make run

For more documentation see /include/firm.h.
To generate FIRM code from a compiler frontend read the documentation
in ./include/ircons.h.
About Firm you can learn in UKA tech-report 1999-??.
