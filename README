This is a library implementing the intermediate representation
FIRM developed at IPD Goos, Uni Karlsruhe.

Create an architecture dependent directory (eg 'mkdir i686-linux') an cd
to it. Call ../configure with wanted features (see ../configure --help
for more hints). Call 'make depend; make' to construct the library. This
creates a file libfirm.a

To test the library goto ./testprograms and make and run the
test examples placed there:

make depend; make
cd testprograms
make
make run

if you have set up the include and libdir using configure you can install
the library and its headers by 'make install'

For more documentation see /include/firm.h.
To generate FIRM code from a compiler frontend read the documentation
in ./include/ircons.h.
About Firm you can learn in UKA tech-report 1999-??.
