This is a library implementing the intermediate representation FIRM
developed at IPD Goos, Uni Karlsruhe.

Create an architecture dependent directory (eg 'mkdir i686-linux') an
cd to it. Call ../configure with wanted features (see ../configure
--help for more hints). Call 'make' to construct the library. This
creates a file libfirm.a

To test the library goto ./<arch>/testprograms and call 'make test'
there.

If you have set up the include and libdir using configure you can
install the library and its headers by 'make install'.  This is
encouraged if the library is hooked up to any other modules, e.g., a
front end.

To generate FIRM code from a compiler frontend read the documentation
"libFIRM: A Library for Compiler Optimization Reaserch Implementing
Firm", UKA tech-report 2002-5. About Firm you can learn in UKA
tech-report 1999-14.
